# Canteen-Management
A Database Management Project to manage orders and bills at food courts using MySQL. There is no automated system in our institute for placing your order online. The current scenario includes placing the order manually. This system could increase the waiting time, therefore this project aimed to create a centralized system where you can access the portal using institute's intranet and place the order online to avoid long queues. The portal is also supposed to be password protected to avoid any discrepancy regarding the billing amount.

The project was specifically designed for our institute, thus it contains a total of six web-pages, one for each canteen. It can be customised as per your convenience. 

There are also signup and signin pages. The final page at the checkout (for bill calculation) will not work unless you have a database file. The same name should be passed as a parameter in the code where SQL queries are written. By looking at the SQL queries (PHP files), you could create your own database provided you keep the name of the columns same as the code (alternatively change the name at both the places).

Below is the snippet of the login/signup page:

The files can be used as a template to create your own database project
